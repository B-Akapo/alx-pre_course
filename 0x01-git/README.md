# Git and Github Project
This project focuses on using Git and Github for version control in software development. Through the course of this project, I have learnt the following concepts and techniques:

## Creating and deleting directories
Use the **`mkdir`** command to create a directory and the **`rmdir`** command to remove/delete an empty directory:
```
$ mkdir new_directory
$ rmdir new_directory
```

## Creating and deleting files
Use the **`touch`** command to create an empty new file and the **`rm`** command to remove a file:

```
$ touch new_file.txt
$ rm new_file.txt
```

## Using echo
you can use **`echo`** to:
- create a non empty file. Note if you use **`echo`** on an existing file, it will delete whatever is in the file and add the new text
- append text to a file. You use this to add a new line to a file without deleting the contents in the file 

```
$ echo "This is some text" > text_file.txt
$ echo "This is more text" >> text_file.txt
```
